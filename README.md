# Education Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes course data from platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and YouTube, exploring trends in course ratings, popularity, and student engagement. It also includes predictive modeling to forecast future trends based on historical data.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and explore course ratings, enrollments, and engagement patterns.
- **Predictive Models**: Predict course ratings and student engagement using machine learning algorithms.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/course-analysis-prediction.git
   cd course-analysis-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or manually install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Jupyter Notebook
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the notebook file and run the cells sequentially for analysis and visualizations.

### Reading CSV Files
To load the course data from a CSV file, you can use the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Replace with the actual file path
course_data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/course_data.csv')
print(course_data.head())
```

Make sure your CSV files are properly formatted and placed in the correct directory.

### Running the Scripts
If you prefer running the script directly:
```bash
python analysis_script.py
```

## Data Sources
- **Coursera**, **Udemy**, **YouTube** (via API or web scraping).
- Data is assumed to be in CSV format and can be loaded using `pd.read_csv()` as shown above.

## Results
- **Predictive Models**: Achieved good performance with RÂ² values of ~0.85 for course ratings.
- **Random Forest** performed best for predicting student engagement.
